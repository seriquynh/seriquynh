### Hi there 👋

My name is Quỳnh, from Vietnam.

I am a software developer who is interested in Linux, MySQL, PHP, JavaScript and various other technologies.

In my free time, I love discovering, reading and contributing (if possible) open source software on GitHub. I also like reading books and playing musical instruments.
